Ensure the LLM class in llm.py is properly implemented to return 4 translation alternatives

## Next Iteration Protocol
Upon completion of the 'Current Actionable Step' above:
1. Determine the *next specific actionable step* (e.g., based on the overall plan or the outcome of the current step).
2. Create a new file (or overwrite the existing one) named 'next_step.md' in the 'ai_docs' directory.
3. The content of this new 'next_step.md' file must include:
    a. The 'Current Actionable Step': [Populate this with the specific step determined in step B.1].
    b. This exact 'Next Iteration Protocol' (sections B.1, B.2, B.3, and B.4).
4. Initiate a new task with the following instructions:
    a. Read the contents of 'ai_docs/next_step.md' (the file just written in step B.2).
    b. Execute the 'Current Actionable Step' detailed within that file.
    c. Follow the 'Next Iteration Protocol' detailed within that file to continue the cycle.
